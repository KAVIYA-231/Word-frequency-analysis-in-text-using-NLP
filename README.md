# Word-frequency-analysis-in-text-using-NLP
This python script performs text preprocessing, word frequency analysis, and visualization of word distribution.it imports necessary libraries, processes a given paragraph by converting it to lowercase, removing stop words, and filtering only alphabetic words.The script then counts word frequencies using Counter and stores the data in a Pandas DataFrame.It identifies the most frequently occuring word and visualizes the data using various plots: a bar chart, a word cloud, a pie chart, and horizontal bar chart, providing insights into word distribution.
Breakdown of its functionalities:
1. importing required libraries:
         nltk,stopword from nltk.corpus,counter from collections,matplotlib.pyplot,pandas,wordCloud from wordCloud
2.Text preprocessing
3.Word  frequency analysis
4.Data visualization
